CHAMP 0.0.1

Objectives:
- Gain familiarity with concepts and methods using simple models
- Develop hypotheses and interesting findings to explore in more detail
- Practice working together
- Set data and model framework for further development

Main Tasks:
1) Setup Github and Pycharm profiles


2) Scripting the framework for CHAMP for further implementation and development
- Home/Setup script:
  - Initialize CHAMP: Asks for name of project and which models to be used. Creates required folders for data management and each of the models 
  - Continuation of previous CHAMP
  - Setup and run CHAMP simulations
- Data management script:
  - Collects and organizes all the data for the models 
  - Set parameters name for each model
- Geographical model
  - Setup of cellular automata (i.e. grid size, upstream/downstream, etc)
  - Define coordinates, area size, elevation, etc. 
- Climate models
  - Data collection or climate models
  - Estimation of climate parameters (PET, drought index, etc)
  - Run statistics
- Groundwater models
  - KGS-WBM
  - MODFLOW
- Crop model
  -SWB
  -AquaCrop
- Irrigation model
  - Irrigation scheduling strategies (rainfed, continuous, decision table, GET-OPTIS, etc)
- ABM
  - Decision-making model
  - Game theory model
  - Netlogo/GAMA

3) Developing the simple models with the goal that passes the relevant information back and forth in simple environment


4) Run scenarios to examine emergent social-environmental phenomena like environmental heterogeneity
   - Develop random heterogeneous fields of aquifer thickness and precipitation variability with different properties
   - Run simulations with just heterogeneous precip, just heterogeneous aquifer, and both heterogeneous
   - Run simulations with and without allowing cells to consider what is happening in neighboring cell when making decisions


5) Answer questions:
   - How does heterogeneity affect the degree to which self-governing groundwater conservation programs develop and function?
   - Does above-ground or below-ground heterogeneity have a greater influence on groundwater use and conservation?
